Comcast xFi thermotate control program

Run
yarn install
react-native link (needed for rn-fetch-blob module)
react-native run-ios or react-native run-android


Implemented by React-native with a WebView loading local web content generated by react=redux (https://github.com/JoeyHuangOne/xfi-thermo-redux).

Note:

A.Web content

React/Webpack generated index.html pointed to js with URL starting with /.
Even though those files are under the root folder (of bundled app), webview need to load the content as './index.html'.
It can't find the js/css with /. So need to update the index.html to load the js/css with ./, instead of /.

Will update Webpack config later to fix this.

B. local file module

rn-fetch-blob module is required. It's a module to access local files inside app bindle. Will use it later to update new local web content.


C.Add web content into mobile app


D. To run on Android simulator

Need to set path to Android adb first, like
export PATH="/Users/yourUser/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools":$PATH



There are several ways to add web content into moile app.
1. Using require
        <WebView
          source={require('./webViewSrc/index.html')}
        ></WebView>
This work well for iOS. Need to verify if it works in Android.

2. In XCode, Add Files into project with create folder reference option
